<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

You have a great react webapp(or any app in general), where you have worked very hard to build lot of functionalities, widgets, layouts etc for the customer. You spent months and years building it.

Now, lets go into customer's shoes!

We all experience at least one website where there are so many options, buttons widgets and you feel lost! The most common and expected reaction is closing the browser tab, because its not good to visit a website and not know where to start.

Thats a user dropout!

This is why it is important for an app to guide user through the initial steps. Or to put it in simple terms, interact with the customer to let them know that you are here to help, and take them through a `Guided Tour` of your web app.

This package is built of the same purpose where you can configure a guided tour for the end user, with lot of customizable options to let you set up a tour that is suitable for the app.
